# Nextjs-TS-Frontend
Multi-page web-app displaying Rick and Morty characters - bootstrapped with NextJs

### How to start the app
The app runs locally on localhost:3000, to run it:

1. Unzip the folder
2. Open a terminal in that location, or open it in your chosen IDE
3. If you don't have yarn - install yarn using
   `npm install --global yarn`

    You might need to run this as an administrator (include `sudo` on MacOS)
    You'll need node package manager https://www.npmjs.com

4. run `yarn install` to install dependencies
5. `yarn dev` will start the app, which can be viewed at http://localhost:3000
6. To run the tests, open another terminal in the same nextjs-ts-frontend folder and run `yarn test`


### It'll look like this!
